# OSU-Holds-Examp
An example repo to showcase how to make judged hold notes, like in OSU for example. (PSYCH)

Will include a step by step guide on how the stuff works, meaning that if changed up a bit should be usable in most engines.
For now the comments next to most of the code should do

# How to add this shit
Check out the commit "Added all the stuff", and insert all the code which has these green lines into their respectful lines
Since the documentation aint ready yet you just have to read where the code goes, but that shouldnt be too hard

### IF YOURE USING THIS ID APPRECIATE CREDIT OR SOME SHIT IN YOUR CREDITS MENU OR WHATEVER LOL!!
Proper documentation coming up here soon, might add more onto this if requested, if you have any issues or questions either message me on discord
(YanniZ06#2996) or open up a issue in this repo
